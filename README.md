Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the text of a speech and visualize the frequency of words using a word cloud. This visualization helps in understanding the key themes and topics discussed in the speech.

Datasets
SPEACH.txt: A text file containing the content of the speech to be analyzed.
Requirements
R (version 4.0.0 or higher)
The following R packages:
tm
SnowballC
wordcloud
RColorBrewer
RCurl
XML

Installation
Install R from CRAN.
Install the required packages by running the following commands in R:
R
Copy code
install.packages("tm")
install.packages("SnowballC")
install.packages("wordcloud")
install.packages("RColorBrewer")
install.packages("RCurl")
install.packages("XML")
Load the libraries in your R script:
R
Copy code
library(tm)
library(SnowballC)
library(wordcloud)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(RCurl)
library(XML)

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Place the SPEACH.txt file in a suitable directory.
Update the file path in the script to point to the correct location of your text file.
Run the script in R or RStudio to perform the text analysis and generate the word cloud.
Steps and Methods

Data Loading
Read the text file using readLines.
Text Preprocessing
Create a text corpus using the tm package.
Perform transformations to clean the text:
Convert text to lower case.
Remove numbers, common stopwords, punctuations, and extra white spaces.
Replace certain patterns with spaces.
Term-Document Matrix
Create a Term-Document Matrix (TDM) to identify the frequency of terms.
Word Frequency Data
Convert the TDM to a matrix and sort the words by frequency.
Create a data frame to store the words and their frequencies.
Word Cloud Generation
Use the wordcloud package to generate a word cloud.
Customize the word cloud with various parameters such as minimum frequency, maximum words, rotation, and colors.

Visualization
The word cloud is generated using the wordcloud package with the RColorBrewer package providing the color palette. The visualization helps in highlighting the most frequent words in the speech, providing insights into the key themes discussed.
